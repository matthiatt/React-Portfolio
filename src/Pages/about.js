          Hello, my name is Matt. I'm a full stack engineer with 1+ years of
          experience. I worked with code as an SEO content engineer for a year,
          and then went back to get further education at Northwestern
          University. I am experienced in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, AJAX, jQuery,
          Express JS, Node JS, SQL, MongoDB, and React
        </p>

        <p>
          My dream is to one day start my own business and become an
          entrepreneur. Right now, I am currently working on an e-commerce site
          called the Wire-Doctor. My moto in e-commerce is - if you're not
          buying what they are selling, then you are the product.
        </p>

        <p>
          One of my hobbies is to learn new concepts, ideas, and skills.
          Knowledge is the greatest asset anyone can obtain. Not just for
          self-improvment, but to also educate others to improve communities and
          individual lives. I take challenges head; failure is success in
          progress. I spend my time in quarantine/isolation by learning
          documentation and how to implement those concepts to make my ideas
          come to fruition.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not learning something new chances are I'm playing WoW or
          some Xbox games. Sidenote - I use Pluralsite a lot to learn about
          different code and how to use them the correct way.
